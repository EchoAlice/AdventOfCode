# AdventOfCode

INTRO
This is my repo of solutions to the challenges presented in Advent Of Code.
Each day from December 1st to December 25th, Advent of Code presents you with
a new problem to solve.  The site explains the problem,
gives you input, and expects you to return the solution.

LAYOUT
Every puzzle has 2 parts.
Each solution is in a seperate file,
but the input is shared between both
.py files

BENEFITS
Advent of Code is a great tool -a stepping stone of sorts- helping me 
learn and grow as a software engineer.
Every problem provokes understanding, and provides knowledge, that
will be leveraged to create new and innovative things.
The goal is to build creative and productive tech
in the blockchain/web3 world.

SHOUTOUT
Huge shoutout to my friend and SWE, Leo, for being a mentor and friend.  I can't
thank you enough for facilitating growth and helping me chase my dreams!
Thank you brother!
