# AdventOfCode

This is my repo of solutions to the challenges presented in Advent Of Code.
Each day from December 1st to December 25th, Advent of Code presents you with
  a new problem to solve.  The site explains the problem needing to be solved,
  gives you input, and expects you to return the solution to the problem.
Every problem has 2 parts.  I have a directory set up for each day of code.  
  Each day has an input, input test, part 1 solution, and part 2 solution file.

Advent of Code is a great tool for me to learn and become a software engineer.
Every problem I tackle is giving me more knowledge and understanding that I will
use to create new and innovative things.  The goal is to build creative and useful tech
in the blockchain/web3 world.

HUGE shoutout to my friend and SWE, Leo, for being a sort of mentor to me.  I can't
thank him enough for helping facilitate my growth as a developer and wanting to see 
me succeed.  Thank you brother!
